## Weather Dashboard

### What is Weather Dashboard?
Weather Dashboard allows a user to input a city name and retrieve a five day forecast for that city.

### How does Weather Dashboard Work?
Weather Dashboard uses jQuery JavaScript open source library methods to query the openweather.org application program interface (API). In particular, it retrieves various weather data such as temperature and UV Index, for the current day, and for a five day forecast.
